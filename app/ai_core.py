# Core AI + threat logic

# Purpose:
# Implements the reasoning layer — turns raw asteroid and environmental data into interpretations and predictions.
# Responsibilities:
# Load trained ML models (if present) or fall back to rule-based heuristics.
# Compute risk classification (Low/Med/High) using input parameters.
# Predict crater size, blast radius, or energy effects.
# Handle mitigation simulation (Δv, lead time → miss distance).

# Key functions/classes:
# def classify_threat(neo_row: dict) -> str:
#     """Simple rule-based or ML classifier returning Low/Medium/High threat badge."""
# def predict_effects(diam_km, v_kms, density_gcc, impact_angle_deg) -> dict:
#     """Compute crater size, blast radius, seismic equivalent, and energy."""
# def simulate_deflection(v_kms, lead_years, method='kinetic') -> dict:
#     """Simulate miss distance change (Δv * lead_time) and return new trajectory outcome."""


# Input: processed asteroid parameters
# Output: dictionary of computed effects + threat rating
# Used by: streamlit_app.py
