# Core AI + threat logic

# Purpose:
# Implements the reasoning layer — turns raw asteroid and environmental data into interpretations and predictions.
# Responsibilities:
# Load trained ML models (if present) or fall back to rule-based heuristics.
# Compute risk classification (Low/Med/High) using input parameters.
# Predict crater size, blast radius, or energy effects.
# Handle mitigation simulation (Δv, lead time → miss distance).

# Key functions/classes:
# def classify_threat(moid_au, diam_km, v_kms):
#     """Returns categorical risk level based on distance and energy."""

# def predict_effects(diam_km, v_kms, density, angle_deg):
#     """Returns crater_diameter_km, blast_radius_km, and impact_energy_mt."""

# def simulate_deflection(strategy, lead_years, delta_v_ms):
#     """Estimates how much deflection is achieved and whether impact is avoided."""


# Input: processed asteroid parameters
# Output: dictionary of computed effects + threat rating
# Used by: streamlit_app.py
